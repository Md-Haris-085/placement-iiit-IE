# Crafting a Cover Letter

A **cover letter** is an important part of your job application, providing a personalized introduction to the hiring team. It complements your resume by highlighting your enthusiasm for the role and your key qualifications.

## Purpose of a Cover Letter

- **Personal Introduction**: It allows you to introduce yourself in a more personal tone than a resume.
- **Highlight Relevant Skills**: You can explain why you're the perfect fit for the position and how your skills align with the company's needs.
- **Demonstrate Enthusiasm**: It’s your chance to show genuine interest in both the role and the company.

## Creating Your Cover Letter

When writing a cover letter, include the following sections:

1. **Header**: Include your contact details and the recipient's information.

   Example:

   ```plaintext
   Name
   Mob | email
   Date: [Insert Date]
   [Recipient's Name]
   [Company Name]
   [Company Address]
   ```

2. **Opening Paragraph**: Introduce yourself and specify the job you’re applying for. Mention where you found the job listing and express enthusiasm.

3. **Body Paragraph(s)**:

   - Highlight your relevant skills and achievements.
   - Explain how your background and experiences make you a strong candidate.
   - Tailor the information to the job description to demonstrate your fit.

4. **Closing Paragraph**: Conclude with a strong statement of your interest in the role and thank them for considering your application. Mention that you look forward to discussing your qualifications further.

5. **Signature**:
   ```plaintext
   Sincerely,
   Name
   ```

## Cover Letter Format

The format of your cover letter should be simple, clear, and professional. Use readable fonts and ensure your cover letter is concise, typically one page in length.

## Note:

Cover letter is generally required when applying **off-campus**.
