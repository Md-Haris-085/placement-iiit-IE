    \nIn a circuit, four switches labeled A, B, C, and D are connected to a logic gate arrangement to control a single output light. The switches can be either in the ON (1) or OFF (0) position. The logic circuit is defined as follows:
    1. Switches A and B are inputs to an AND gate.
    2. Switches C and D are inputs to an OR gate.
    3. The outputs of both the AND and the OR gates are then \n\tinput to an XOR (exclusive OR) gate, which controls \n\tthe output light.
Which combination of switch positions (ON=1, OFF=0) will turn the output light ON?    `,

    \nSuppose you are given three variables X, Y, and Z. The Pearson correlation coefficients for (X, Y), (Y, Z), and (X, Z) are C1, C2, and C3 respectively.
Now, you have added 2 to all values of X (i.e., new values become X+2), subtracted 2 from all values of Y (i.e., new values are Y-2), and Z remains the same. The new coefficients for (X, Y), (Y, Z), and (X, Z) are given by D1, D2, and D3 respectively. How do the values of D1, D2, and D3 relate to C1, C2, and C3?
